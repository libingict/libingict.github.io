		<h1>Efficient and Robust AI System Seminar</h1>

		<p>  Artificial intelligence(AI), especially deep neural network has achieved striking successes in many fields. However, their deployment and application are too expensive in terms of computing/storage resource and their security rise severe concern in safety-sensitive area. These challenges trigger various innovations from different perspectives (i.e., algorithms, compiler, computing architecture, and cross-layer optimization) to realize an efficient and robust artificial intelligence system.</p>
